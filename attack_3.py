# basically, output is x(r*Q), and the
# current state (after output) is x(r*P)
# so, if we know e s.t. P = e*Q then...
# r*P = r*(e*Q) = re * Q = e*(r*Q)
# so, given two candidate points from x(r*Q),
# we have two canddiates for r*P. simply make
# 2 prngs seeded by either candidate, then test
# their next output against target prng
